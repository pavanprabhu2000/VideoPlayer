# VideoPlayer

### Playing audio or video in Android apps is a common requirement for many projects. Many apps in the Google Play Store, even some non-streaming ones, provide audio and video playback. We have built an Android app that plays video from various sources, such as videos locally stored in your phone, the res folder, gallery and a URL using Media Player.

### The VideoPlayer is an app that can play almost any format of audio/video out of the box and various streaming protocols and any codec .It might even read disk images (iso) and play directly. The Media player has a Fast-forward button for forward and backward seeking.We have built an Android app using the exo player library from google .
